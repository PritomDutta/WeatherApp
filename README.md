The architecture of this app was based upon https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/blob/master/architecture_guidelines/android_architecture.md with custom modifications like not using an Eventbus as this is not needed in an Rx flow based app. The app still uses the MVP Pattern for the presentation layer.

## Build Instructions

In order to run this project, you'll need to setup several things beforehand:

- Our application uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org) to obtain information about current weather and forecasts,
you'll need to register and obtain an API Key

- You'll need to set the values found in the [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) file.
This involves the OpenWeatherMap Api Key (`apiToken`)
